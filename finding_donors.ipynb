    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Forest\n",
    " - Use-cases: In finance, it is used to detect customers more likely to repay their debt on time, or use a bank's services more frequently. In this domain it is also used to detect fraudsters out to scam the bank. In trading, the algorithm can be used to determine a stock's future behavior. Random forests can also be used on city data for urban planning. \n",
    " - Strengths: Random forests are fast, flexible, robust, they can cope with high-dimensional data (i.e. few observations but many predictor variables). It creates as many trees on the subset and combines these outputs which reduces the problem of overfitting. This algorithm is stable because even if a new data point is introduced, only one of the trees will be affected instead of the whole algorithm.\n",
    " - Weaknesses: Complexity - Random forest creates lots of trees and combines their outputs, because of which the algorithm requires more computational power and resources. Longer training period - Because it generates so many trees, the time taken for training increases.\n",
    " - Our data contains both categorical and continuous variables. Random forest works well with both categorical and continuous variables. Even though we've performed normalisation of variables, it is not necessary if random forest algorithm is used on our data.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Gradient Boosting\n",
    " - Use-cases: Gradient boosting can be used in the field of learning to rank. The commercial web search engines Yahoo use variants of gradient boosting in their machine-learned ranking engines.\n",
    " - Strengths: It provides lots of flexibility with several hyperparameter tuning options that make the function fit very flexible. It does not require pre-processing of data and works well for both categorical and numerical data. It builds trees one at a time and learns from the error in the previous tree, instead of building all trees in one go.\n",
    " - Weaknesses: Gradient boosting will continue to minimize errors which might lead to overfitting. Like random forests, it creates lots of trees which utilizes too much computational power and resources. It requires large grid search for tuning.\n",
    " - Gradient boosting works well with both categorical and numeric data which is the case in our dataset. \n",

    "3. Support Vector Machines\n",
    " - Use-cases: Face detection – SVMs classify parts of the image as a face and non-face and create a square boundary around the face. Bioinformatics – It includes protein classification and cancer classification. SVMs are used for identifying the classification of genes, patients on the basis of genes and other biological problems.\n",
    " - Strengths: It handles outliers better, as it derives maximum margin solution. The risk of overfitting is less in SVM. SVM is relatively memory efficient. SVM’s are very good when we have no idea on the data.\n",
    " - Weaknesses: Very long training time. In cases where number of features for each data point exceeds the number of training data sample , the SVM will under perform.\n",
    " - The kernel trick of SVM will especially be helpful in solving any complex problem including our problem dataset.\n",

    "Boosting is an ensemble method which trains a bunch of individual models (usually decision trees) in a sequential way. Each individual model learns from the mistakes of the previous model. Gradient Boosting is a boosting algorithm which learns from it's mistakes to give a better model. Boosting is regarded as a sequential since outcome of one model is the input to the next model. Here, a weak learner is used to fit the data. Because it is weak, it will not be able to fit the data correctly. The weaknesses in such a learner will be fixed by another weak learner. If some weaknesses still exist, then another weak learner will be used to fix them. The chain got extended until finally producing a strong learner from multiple weak learners.\n",

    "To explain in detail, in Gradient Boosting algorithm our dataset is first fitted to the model. Once fitted, our model can be used to predict. Using this prediction, we can calculate the residual error. This compromises of the steps of one weak learner. Before going to the next weak learner, the error obtained in the previous weak learner is reduced and then the model is again fitted to the optimised data. Here, each subsequent learner is learning from its predecessor by minimizing the error using gradient descent."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
